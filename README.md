This repo is **incomplete** and will provide examples for streaming audio with the new Fetch &amp; Streams APIs.

Development will occur in the following phases:

1. **WAV Decoding - Proof of Concept** &nbsp; ✅ *complete*<br>Streaming local WAV files works as intended.  Remote files don't stream proplerly due to the chunks received that contain odd (not even) number of total bytes.
1. **WAV Decoding - Buffered Read** &nbsp; 😶 *incomplete*<br>Bytes read will be scheduled into a read buffer to prevent failed chunk decoding resulting from incomplete chunks
1. **Opus Decoding** &nbsp; 😶 *incomplete*<br>WebAssembly will be used to decode [Opus](http://opus-codec.org/) files.  (MP3 is outdated).  This would simulate a real-world use case of streaming compressed audio over the web.
